# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, I imported school and student data from two csv files, then used the data to calculate student performance across several metrics, then look for trends related to student performance related to other factors, such as the type of school, size of the school (i.e., student population size), and spending per student. Below are the following steps that were performed to complete the analysis.

<br />

1. District Summary:  create code to perform the necessary calculations and generate a "District Summary" with the following information:

    * Total number of unique schools
    * Total students
    * Total budget
    * Average math score
    * Average reading score
    * % of students passing math
    * % of students passing reading
    * % of students passing overall (i.e., passing both math and reading)

<br />

2. School Summary:  create code to perform the necessary calculations and generate a "School Summary" with the following information for each school:

    * School name
    * School type
    * Total students
    * Total budget
    * Per student budget
    * Average math score
    * Average reading score
    * % of students passing math
    * % of students passing reading
    * % of students passing overall

<br />

3. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):  sort the schools in the "School Summary" by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

<br />

4. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):  sort the schools in the "School Summary" by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

<br />

5. Math Scores by Grade:  create code to perform the necessary calculations and create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

<br />

6. Reading Scores by Grade:  create code to perform the necessary calculations and create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

<br />

7. Scores by School Spending:  create code to perform the necessary calculations and generate a new DataFrame that displays the following information, based on different per capita budget ranges:

    * Average math score
    * Average reading score
    * % of students passing math
    * % of students passing reading
    * % of students passing overall

<br />

8. Scores by School Size:  create code to perform the necessary calculations and generate a new DataFrame that displays the following information, based on school size (i.e., student population):

    * Average math score
    * Average reading score
    * % of students passing math
    * % of students passing reading
    * % of students passing overall
    
<br />

9. Scores by School Type:  create code to perform the necessary calculations and generate a new DataFrame that displays the following information, based on school type (Charter or District):

    * Average math score
    * Average reading score
    * % of students passing math
    * % of students passing reading
    * % of students passing overall

<br />

10. Based on the analysis performed, write a summary of the results and possible conclusions that can be drawn from the data.
